  abstract = {This paper describes our participation in the tool competition organized in the scope of the 1st International Workshop on Natural Language-based Software Engineering. We propose a supervised approach relying on fine-tuned BERT-based language models for the automatic classification of GitHub issues. We experimented with different pre-trained models, achieving the best performance with fine-tuned RoBERTa (F1 = .8591).},

  abstract = {Issue classification aims to recognize whether an issue reports a bug, a request for enhancement or support. In this paper we use pre-trained models for the automatic classification of issues and investigate how the quality of data affects the performance of classifiers. Despite the application of data quality filters, none of our attempts had a significant effect on model quality. As root cause we identify a threat to construct validity underlying the issue labeling. Editor's note: Open Science material was validated by the Journal of Systems and Software Open Science Board.},
